I am Heejun Lee. I am a Ph.D. student at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  AI. Hello, World! 🐱

My research interest includes:
- Neural Network Compression and Computation Optimization (Currently, I am focusing on an attention mechanism)
- Large-scale Machine Learning System Design, Development, and Serving (This is why I am working with DeepAuto.AI)
- General Purpose AI (NLP/CV)

## Education
- KAIST | Sep. 2024 - | Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence
- KAIST | Mar. 2020 - Aug. 2024 | B.S. in Computer Science
